## **About Kashword: Empowering Your Password Security**

Welcome to Kashword, your personalized password hashing tool that puts you in control of your password logic. At Kashword, we understand the significance of password security in today's digital age. That's why we've created a unique platform that allows you to generate custom hashes based on your input, ensuring a higher level of security and privacy for your online accounts.

### **How Kashword Works**

Kashword empowers you to create cyphered passwords based on your unique logic. By using our platform, you can input your personalized password logic, which we then transform into a hashed code that acts as your password. This hashed code can be shared with trusted friends and family, granting them access to specific applications or accounts without revealing your original password logic.

### **Take Back Control**

Our mission is to give you control over your password security. Even if a website or application does not use a hashing method, Kashword allows you to maintain the security of your accounts by implementing your customized password logic. This way, your sensitive information remains protected, and you retain control over who can access your accounts.

### **Why Choose Kashword?**

- **Enhanced Security:** Our hashing process ensures that your password logic remains private, enhancing the security of your accounts.
- **User Empowerment:** You dictate your password logic, providing an additional layer of protection for your online presence.
- **Sharing Made Safe:** Share your hashed password with trusted individuals, granting them access without disclosing your actual password.
- **Immune to Rainbow Table Attacks:** Your password will be unique for every site, so it is immune to rainbow table attacks.

#### *Note:* we always recommend you to use Kashword python script if not possible then use the Kashword website. Both options are safe and reliable, but the python script gives you more control and flexibility over the password generation process.

If you want to take your security to the next level, you should check out Pashword. It uses Scrypt and SHA3-512 on multiple user inputs, which makes it much harder to brute-force.
